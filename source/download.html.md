**vroom** is currently under *heavy* development. There is no stable release.
The easiest (and recommended) method for installing **vroom** is to install it
from the [keckcaves PPA](https://launchpad.net/~keckcaves/+archive/ppa) (see
below).

### ubuntu/debian systems

Add the keckcaves PPA.

~~~ bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:keckcaves/ppa
~~~

Update APT and install the vroom package.

~~~ bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install vroom
~~~

### installing from source

The source for the project can be downloaded from
[github](https://github.com/jvan/vroom). If installing from source you will
need to install and compile a number of other packages (see the README file).
