Internal interaction function. Called whenever a button is pressed. 

<%= partial "partials/internal_function_warning" %>

### usage

~~~python
def button_press(position, button):
   # interaction code goes here...
~~~

### paramaters

position | (x, y, z) position of the cursor location
button   | button ID value


### example

In the following example we use the `button_press()` function to add 
points whenever the user presses the button.


~~~python
def init():
   Global.points = [] # start with an empty array

def display():
   # Draw a sphere at each point the user pressed the button
   material(0, 1, 1)
   draw(sphere, 1.0, style='solid').for_each(Global.points)

def button_press(pos, button):
   # Add a point at the current cursor position. In this example
   # we do not need to use the button ID value, however it will be
   # passed to the function by vroom so it must be in the function
   # definition.

   Global.points.append(pos)
